# minecraft-library
A collection of various utilities and objects for minecraft modding.

While this repository isn't intended for public use (as I will be ruthlessly making breaking changes whenever I need to) I suppose there isn't really any harm in letting others take a peek to see my way of doing things.

This code is released to you entirely without guarantees of quality or stability, use at your own risk!
