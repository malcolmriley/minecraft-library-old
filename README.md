# minecraft-library
A collection of various utilities and objects for minecraft modding.

While this repository isn't intended for public use (as I will be ruthlessly making breaking changes whenever I need to) I suppose there isn't really any harm in letting others take a peek to see my way of doing things.

Since my projects tend to be for private use, this library tends to be used as a git submodule in the dependent project, so it is not really set up to be used as an API; thus this code is released to you entirely without guarantees of organization, quality or stability. Use at your own risk!
